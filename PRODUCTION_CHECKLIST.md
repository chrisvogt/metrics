# Production Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- [ ] Firebase project is properly configured
- [ ] Google Sign-In is enabled in Authentication
- [ ] Authorized domains include `*.chrisvogt.me`
- [ ] OAuth consent screen is configured
- [ ] `firebase-config.js` contains actual Firebase config (not placeholders)

### 2. Security
- [ ] `token.json` (service account key) is secure and not committed to git
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] CORS settings include your production domains
- [ ] Domain restriction is working (`@chrisvogt.me` only)

### 3. Code Quality
- [ ] All linter errors are resolved
- [ ] Tests are passing
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Logging is properly configured

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Functions
```bash
cd functions
npm run deploy
```

### 2. Deploy Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Functions are deployed and accessible
- [ ] Hosting is serving the correct files
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Protected endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Public endpoints are accessible

## üîí Production Security Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- JWT token validation
- Domain restriction (`@chrisvogt.me`)
- Rate limiting on protected endpoints
- CORS protection
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Secure token storage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Additions
- [ ] Set up Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Configure Cloud Monitoring alerts
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Implement automatic token refresh
- [ ] Add request/response logging
- [ ] Set up backup for service account key

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Firebase Console
- [ ] Authentication usage metrics
- [ ] Function execution logs
- [ ] Error reporting
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### Custom Monitoring
- [ ] API usage tracking
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Response time tracking
- [ ] User activity logging

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor function logs for errors
- [ ] Check authentication usage
- [ ] Review rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Backup service account credentials

### Security Updates
- [ ] Keep Firebase SDK updated
- [ ] Monitor for security advisories
- [ ] Review access logs regularly
- [ ] Update CORS settings as needed

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication fails**: Check Firebase config and domain settings
2. **CORS errors**: Verify domain is in allowlist
3. **Rate limiting**: Check if limits are appropriate for your usage
4. **Token expiration**: Implement automatic refresh if needed

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check function logs
firebase functions:log

# Test authentication locally
firebase emulators:start

# Verify deployment
firebase hosting:channel:list
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Current Optimizations
- Compression middleware enabled
- Caching headers on public endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Efficient JWT validation

### Future Optimizations
- [ ] Implement response caching
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
- [ ] Optimize function cold starts
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Function response time < 500ms
- [ ] Authentication success rate > 99%
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Uptime > 99.9%

### Business Metrics
- [ ] User adoption rate
- [ ] API usage patterns
- [ ] Authentication conversion rate
- [ ] Support ticket volume
