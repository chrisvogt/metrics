# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.25.2] - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- **Goodreads AI summary** – Gemini prompt asks for **two or three** `<p>` paragraphs (replacing “exactly two”). `normalizeParagraphSummary` keeps **all** returned `<p>` blocks; the homepage UI collapses extra paragraphs behind “Read more,” so the backend no longer truncates a third paragraph.

### Developer experience

- **Tests** – `generate-goodreads-summary` asserts full multi-paragraph HTML and updated prompt copy.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **CORS** – Apply `cors` once for all `/api` routes **before** CSRF so **OPTIONS** preflight succeeds. Cross-origin `fetch` to `*.cloudfunctions.net` with `Authorization` (manual sync SSE from Firebase Hosting) only runs `cors()` on `app.get()`, so preflight previously missed CORS and the browser blocked the stream.

### Developer experience

- **Tests** – Supertest `OPTIONS` preflight for `GET /api/widgets/sync/:provider/stream`.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- **Manual sync SSE** – Authenticated `GET /api/widgets/sync/:provider/stream` returns **`text/event-stream`** (`progress`, then `done` or `error`) using the same enqueue → claim → inline `processSyncJob` path as the JSON route.
- **Progress hooks** – `SyncProgressReporter` / optional `onProgress` on `SyncJobExecutionOptions`; sync jobs for Spotify, Steam, Goodreads, Instagram, Discogs, and Flickr emit step updates for the stream.

### Changed

- **Compression** – `compression` middleware skips widget sync paths ending in **`/stream`** so SSE is not buffered.
- **Discogs** – `fetch-releases-batch` accepts `onProgress` and reports batch-level progress for richer SSE updates.

### Developer experience

- **Tests** – Route coverage for SSE manual sync (`create-express-app.route-coverage.test.ts`).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Goodreads AI reading context** – Paginated fetch of the full “read” shelf from Goodreads XML only (`fetch-full-read-shelf-for-ai`), passed to Gemini for summaries without enriching extra titles via Google Books or cover downloads. Widget `recentlyReadBooks` and display pipeline are unchanged.
- **Config** – `GOODREADS_AI_READ_SHELF_PER_PAGE` (200) and `GOODREADS_AI_READ_SHELF_MAX_PAGES` (10) in `goodreads-config.ts`.

### Changed

- **Goodreads Gemini prompt** – Homepage-oriented copy for chrisvogt.me: exactly **two** third-person `<p>` blocks; uses `completeReadShelf` plus `recentlyReadBooksForWidget` in the prompt. `ensureTwoParagraphSummary` keeps the first two paragraphs if the model returns more.
- **Sync resilience** – If full-shelf pagination throws, the job logs a warning and the summary still runs using widget books only.

### Developer experience

- **Tests** – Coverage for shelf parsing edge cases, summary fallbacks, and `sync-goodreads-data` branches (mixed CDN vs fetch, non-`Error` rejections, staggered fetches).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-21

### BREAKING

- **Manual widget sync HTTP response** – `GET /api/widgets/sync/:provider` no longer returns `{ result, provider }`. It now returns a queue-backed payload (`enqueue`, `beforeJob`, `afterJob`, `worker`) from `runSyncForProvider`. Clients must parse the new shape.
- **Instagram configuration** – `INSTAGRAM_USER_ID` is required (see `.env.template`). `fetchInstagramMedia` throws if it is missing. Instagram Graph calls use separate profile and media requests (`v25.0`), merged into the previous top-level response shape with a `media` field.

### Added

- **Firestore sync job queue** – Widget syncs are enqueued in the `sync_jobs` collection (`FirestoreSyncJobQueue`), claimed by a scheduled worker (`runSyncWorker`, every 15 minutes), and planned by `runSyncPlanner` (daily). Manual sync enqueues then claims the same job id and runs inline so the HTTP response includes queue state. See [docs/SYNC_JOB_QUEUE.md](../docs/SYNC_JOB_QUEUE.md).
- **Queue port and types** – `SyncJobQueue` (`ports/sync-job-queue.ts`), pipeline types (`types/sync-pipeline.ts`), and adapter tests (`adapters/sync/firestore-sync-job-queue.test.ts`).

### Changed

- **Sync queue metrics** – Optional **`metrics`** on successful `SyncJobResult` (`types/sync-job.ts`) are merged into the Firestore job **`summary`** by `processSyncJob` (`services/sync-worker.ts`). Provider jobs own the numbers (e.g. Steam’s `ownedGamesCount` / `recentlyPlayedGamesCount` from `sync-steam-data.ts`); the worker does not parse provider-specific `data` for metrics.
- **Instagram Graph fetch** – Uses `prefixUrl` and `searchParams` for `got` instead of embedding the access token in a URL string literal. Caps top-level media at 24 items via a dedicated `{userId}/media` request.
- **Build output** – `functions/lib/` is gitignored; compile with `pnpm run build` before deploy (aligned with the existing TypeScript layout).

### Fixed

- **Goodreads sync optimization** – Previously fetched 100 books from Goodreads, then called Google Books API and downloaded thumbnails for all of them, but only stored 18. Now fetches 30 books (per_page), processes only those 30 (early slice before pMap), and stores 24 for display. Reduces Google Books API usage and rate limiting. See [#175](https://github.com/chrisvogt/metrics/issues/175).

## [0.22.18] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **GCS bucket config timing** – `GcsMediaStore` previously read `CLOUD_STORAGE_IMAGES_BUCKET` from constants at module load time, before `FUNCTIONS_CONFIG_EXPORT` was applied. In production, the bucket was always undefined, causing "Bucket name not specified or invalid" on sync jobs. Now reads from `getStorageConfig()` at runtime (after the secret is loaded). If the bucket is still missing, throws a clearer error pointing to the secret. See [#177](https://github.com/chrisvogt/metrics/issues/177).

## [0.22.17] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Widget GET CDN caching** – Global `lusca` CSRF was calling `setToken` on every request, so `GET /api/widgets/:provider` responses included `Set-Cookie` (`_csrfSecret`, `XSRF-TOKEN`). Shared caches then refused to store them (`x-cache: MISS`) despite `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage`. Public widget reads are now excluded from CSRF (exact `/api/widgets/<id>` for each `widgetId`); `/api/widgets/sync/*` is unchanged. Tests assert no `set-cookie` on successful widget reads.

## [0.22.16] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- **Shared Goodreads XML parsing utility** – Extracted common xml2js text-node extraction into `utils/goodreads-xml.ts` and reused it across Goodreads recently-read and sync flows to reduce duplicated parsing logic.
- **CI strict typecheck** – CI now runs `pnpm run typecheck` (strict core) so Goodreads shape/type issues are caught earlier.

## [0.22.15] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **Functions deploy config isolation** – Local development now prefers `functions/.env.local`, deploys fail fast when `functions/.env` is present, and direct Firebase CLI deploys run the same guard during predeploy so local disk-backed settings do not leak into production runtime config.
- **Node 24 runtime startup** – Moved `dotenv` into runtime dependencies so newly deployed Cloud Functions revisions can import the shared config bootstrap successfully during startup.

### Developer experience

- **Firebase param handoff** – Documented the split between local-only env files, Firebase deploy-time parameter files, and the `FUNCTIONS_CONFIG_EXPORT` Secret Manager payload so local disk storage remains available without interfering with production Firestore/GCS deploys.

## [0.22.14] - 2026-03-15

### Developer experience

- **Service-boundary integration coverage** – Added focused seam tests for default `FirestoreDocumentStore` wiring in the Flickr sync wrapper and Spotify widget reader, so the provider-neutral service boundaries are protected without depending on broad runtime-level tests.

## [0.22.13] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Provider-neutral auth boundary** – Auth and session operations now flow through a dedicated `AuthService` port instead of calling Firebase Admin Auth directly from the Express app, keeping non-auth app logic isolated from the Firebase-specific implementation.
- **Firebase auth adapter** – Added a Firebase-backed auth adapter that owns session-cookie verification, ID-token verification, session creation, user lookup, logout token revocation, and auth-user deletion behind a single provider-specific implementation.

### Developer experience

- **Focused auth-boundary coverage** – Added adapter-level tests for the Firebase auth mapping layer and updated app tests to mock the provider-neutral auth boundary directly, making the migration seam easier to evolve safely.

### Changed

- **Source layout (config / widgets / utils / helpers)** – Source that lived under `lib/` has been moved into role-based directories so that `lib/` is build output only and can be fully gitignored:
  - **config/** – `constants.ts`, `exported-config.ts` (and tests)
  - **widgets/** – `get-widget-content.ts`, all provider-specific widget getters, `queries/github-widget-content.gql`, and widget tests
  - **utils/** – `extract-json-from-gemini-response.ts` (and test)
  - **helpers/** – `get-user-status.ts`, `get-review.ts` (and get-user-status test)
  - **lib/** – Now contains only `tsc` output; added to `.gitignore`. Run `pnpm run build` before deploy.
  - Imports updated across `index`, `api/`, `jobs/`, `transformers/`, and tests. README and ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md now reference `config/exported-config.ts`.
- **Dependency upgrades** – Bumped to latest majors: ESLint 10, Vitest 4, dotenv 17, globals 17, requestretry 8. Adjusted for ESLint 10 (preserve-caught-error, no-unassigned-vars), Vitest 4 constructor mocks (use `function` not arrow in mocks), and sync-spotify-data `uploadResult` scope.
- **Dependency updates** – axios 1.13.6, express-rate-limit 8.3.0 (IPv6 subnet grouping; no API changes), firebase 12.10.0, firebase-admin 13.7.0, firebase-functions 7.1.0, eslint 10.0.3, globals 17.4.0. @types/node kept at ^24 for Node 24.
- **Dependency cleanup** – Replaced deprecated packages: `lodash.get` → `lodash/get` (same API); Spotify token refresh now uses `got` instead of `request-promise` (and removed direct `request` / `request-promise` deps). No behavior change.

### Fixed

- **Auth routes** – `POST /api/auth/session` and `POST /api/auth/logout` now use the rate limiter (20 and 30 requests per 15 minutes respectively) so every route that performs authorization is rate-limited (CodeQL compliance).

## [0.22.12] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Provider-neutral media service boundary** – Media-heavy sync flows now call a shared media service layer instead of importing GCP-named helper modules directly, keeping provider logic independent from the underlying blob storage implementation.
- **Provider-neutral public media config** – Added `MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` as the preferred environment setting for generated media URLs while preserving `IMAGE_CDN_BASE_URL` as a compatibility alias for existing deployments.
- **Explicit backend selection** – Media store resolution now fails fast for unsupported backends instead of silently falling back to GCS, which makes future container- or S3-backed experiments safer.

### Developer experience

- **Disk-backed deployment docs** – Updated the env template and setup docs to document the disk-backed media path used for local or container-hosted deployments.
- **Focused media boundary coverage** – Refreshed sync-job, transformer, config, and Goodreads media tests around the new media service seam to keep the refactor well-covered.

## [0.22.11] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Backend document writes on `DocumentStore`** – User creation/deletion flows plus the Discogs, Goodreads, Instagram, Spotify, and Steam sync jobs now persist through the shared `DocumentStore` boundary instead of calling Firestore directly.
- **Consistent document paths** – Remaining backend write paths now save user documents, raw provider responses, widget payloads, and generated summaries through the same provider-neutral path contract used by widget reads.

### Developer experience

- **Backend job coverage** – Reworked account-flow and sync-job tests to inject `DocumentStore` directly, and added focused Spotify and Steam sync coverage to keep the storage seam well-tested during the migration.

## [0.22.10] - 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Widget reads on `DocumentStore`** – Discogs, Instagram, Spotify, and Steam widget readers now load their `widget-content` documents through the shared `DocumentStore` boundary instead of reaching into Firestore directly.
- **Consistent widget paths** – Provider widget reads now use the shared widget document path helpers so public widget loading follows the same provider-neutral storage contract across all supported providers.

### Developer experience

- **Widget reader coverage** – Replaced Firestore-specific widget reader tests with `DocumentStore`-backed coverage and added a dedicated Steam widget reader test to keep the provider read seam well-covered during the migration.

## [0.22.9] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **CSRF protection** – Added cookie-backed CSRF protection to the functions app using `lusca`, plus a small `/api/csrf-token` helper endpoint so the hosting admin can fetch a token before state-changing requests.

### Changed

- **Admin client auth flow** – The hosting API client now fetches and forwards `X-XSRF-TOKEN` on session creation and logout calls, and the API testing screen now uses that same client path.
- **Protected route handling** – State-changing auth routes now return structured `403` JSON errors when the CSRF token is missing or invalid instead of falling through to generic error handling.

### Developer experience

- **Coverage and tests** – Updated route tests to exercise the CSRF-protected flows and kept the full `functions` suite green after the security hardening.

## [0.22.8] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Firebase runtime wrappers** – Added dedicated runtime adapters for Firebase Admin initialization and Firebase Functions registration so admin bootstrap, emulator wiring, and trigger registration are owned outside the service entrypoint.
- **App factory seam** – Added `app/create-express-app.ts` so the API surface can be composed from injected runtime dependencies instead of being defined inline in the Firebase bootstrap file.

### Changed

- **Thin entrypoint** – `index.ts` now acts as a composition layer that wires together runtime config, Firebase runtime adapters, the shared document store, and the Express app factory.
- **Trigger registration** – Scheduled jobs, the HTTP app wrapper, and the before-user-created trigger now register through shared Firebase runtime helpers instead of calling Firebase Functions APIs directly in the entrypoint.

### Developer experience

- **Runtime coverage** – Added focused tests for Firebase admin bootstrap and Firebase Functions registration wrappers while keeping the full `index` and `functions` suites green after the extraction.

## [0.22.7] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Runtime config boundary** – Added a provider-neutral runtime config loader in `config/runtime-config.ts` plus focused tests so runtime env/bootstrap behavior is owned by a dedicated seam instead of being embedded directly in the Firebase entrypoint.
- **Firebase runtime adapters** – Added Firebase-specific runtime adapters for exported config loading, Firestore database URL resolution, and emulator wiring under `runtime/` so platform-specific config concerns are isolated from the service layer.

### Changed

- **Entrypoint config loading** – `index.ts` now consumes the runtime config boundary and Firebase adapter modules instead of importing Firebase params and exported-config helpers directly.

### Developer experience

- **Test noise** – Tightened index and sync-job tests to mock logger/console output more explicitly and added direct emulator helper coverage so Firebase-flavored bootstrap behavior is easier to reason about in unit tests.

## [0.22.6] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Backend path config overrides** – Added `DEFAULT_WIDGET_USER_ID` and `WIDGET_USER_ID_BY_HOSTNAME` support so the default widget user and hostname-to-user routing can be configured without code changes.

### Changed

- **Provider path resolution** – Replaced precomputed per-user collection and media path constants with runtime path builders so sync jobs, widget reads, and media destination helpers no longer treat one hardcoded username as a structural constant.
- **Provider sync persistence** – Discogs, Goodreads, Instagram, Spotify, Steam, and Flickr persistence paths now resolve through the shared backend path layer, preserving existing document layouts while making alternate deployments easier to configure.

### Developer experience

- **Coverage** – Added focused config/path override tests and updated transformer/widget coverage around the new runtime path resolution.

## [0.22.5] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Backend path helpers** – Added explicit user/provider path builders for Firestore collection paths, media prefixes, and widget host-to-user resolution so backend path generation is owned by a dedicated layer instead of scattered string literals.

### Changed

- **Path constants** – Reworked backend collection/media constants to derive from the shared path helpers while preserving the current `chrisvogt` and `chronogrove` behavior.
- **Widget reads** – Flickr and Goodreads widget readers now respect the passed `userId` when building widget-content document paths instead of implicitly reading from the default hardcoded user path.

### Developer experience

- **Coverage** – Added focused tests for the new backend path helpers and updated widget/helper coverage for user-aware widget document paths.

## [0.22.4] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Media storage seam** – Added a provider-neutral `MediaStore` abstraction with GCS and local-disk adapters so media-heavy sync flows can switch storage backends without changing provider logic.
- **Local media serving** – Added a local `/api/media/*` route for development so disk-backed uploads can be viewed through the same API surface used by widget media URLs.

### Changed

- **Media upload/list helpers** – Switched the shared cloud-storage helpers to delegate through the new media storage selector, preserving current GCS behavior in production while defaulting to disk in local development.
- **Runtime config mapping** – Added `MEDIA_STORE_BACKEND` and `LOCAL_MEDIA_ROOT` support to exported-config/env setup so storage backend selection is environment-driven.

### Fixed

- **Local dotenv loading** – Functions now load `functions/.env` synchronously from a stable path in development so browser-triggered emulator requests use the same local storage/media settings consistently.

### Developer experience

- **Coverage** – Added focused adapter, selector, helper, and sync-job coverage for the new media storage seam and local-disk flow.

## [0.22.3] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **Widget read seam** – Moved Flickr and Goodreads widget document reads onto the `DocumentStore` boundary while keeping the existing Firestore document layout and API payload shapes unchanged.
- **Widget loading path** – `getWidgetContent` now accepts an injected `DocumentStore` so the widget API route can pass the shared storage adapter through the read path instead of instantiating Firestore-specific readers.

### Fixed

- **Timestamp normalization** – Centralized widget read-side timestamp conversion for `meta.synced` values so Firestore timestamp-like objects and `toDate()` wrappers are handled consistently at the read boundary.

### Developer experience

- **Coverage** – Added focused tests for `DocumentStore`-backed widget readers and the shared widget document-store helper to keep the backend decoupling seam well covered.

## [0.22.2] - 2026-03-07

### Security

- **CORS** – Removed temporary domain `8ms.4a9.mytemp.website` from the production CORS allowlist. Unit test for that origin removed.

### Changed

- **Hosting (sign-in page)** – Clarified that the app is a personal admin, not a general login service:
  - Added line under “Sign in”: “Personal admin for metrics.chrisvogt.me / chrisvogt.me only.”
  - Added “← Part of chrisvogt.me” link to chrisvogt.me above the sign-in card.
  - Added meta description and Open Graph tags in `index.html`: “Personal Metrics API admin for chrisvogt.me. Not a general login service.”

## [0.22.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **Build** – Copy `queries/` (e.g. `github-widget-content.gql`) into `lib/queries/` during build so the GitHub widget loader finds the file at runtime in emulator and production.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-02-14

### Added

- **Goodreads recently-read fallback** – When Google Books returns no result for an ISBN, the recently-read flow now tries a title/author search (same behavior as profile updates), so more books are recovered (e.g. *Culture of Desire*, *Purposeful*, *Outliers*). Title and author are read from the Goodreads review list XML.

### Changed

- **Google Books “not found” logging** – A missing ISBN result is now logged at **info** (“No result from Google Books for ISBN: …; title/author fallback may be used.”) instead of an error. A **warning** is logged only when a book is not found by either ISBN or the title/author fallback.

## [0.21.0] - 2025-02-14

### Added

- **React hosting app** – The metrics dashboard is now a Vite + React app in `hosting/`:
  - Sign-in (Google, email/password, phone) and API testing UI
  - Two pages when signed in: **API** (auth token, session, widget GET) and **Sync** (sync-by-provider)
  - Firebase config loaded at runtime from `/api/firebase-config`; no client-side keys
  - Dedicated `hosting/package.json` and build output in `hosting/dist`

### Changed

- **Firebase Hosting** – `firebase.json` now serves the built React app:
  - `hosting.public` set to `hosting/dist` (replaces legacy `public/` static files)
  - Rewrites: `/api/**` → Cloud Function `app`, `**` → `/index.html` (SPA fallback)
- **Root scripts** – From repo root (pnpm + Turborepo): `pnpm run build` builds the hosting app; `pnpm run deploy:all` builds then deploys; `pnpm run deploy:hosting` builds and deploys hosting only.

### Developer experience

- Local dev: from repo root run `pnpm run dev` with Functions + Auth emulators, or build and use `firebase emulators:start --only hosting,functions,auth`. See root [README](../README.md) and [hosting/README.md](../hosting/README.md).

**Update:** Hosting later moved from Vite to **Next.js** (static export to `hosting/out`), and the Hosting catch-all rewrite to `/index.html` was removed so unknown URLs use **`404.html`**. See [hosting/CHANGELOG.md](../hosting/CHANGELOG.md).

## [0.20.2] - 2025-02-14

### Fixed

- **AI summaries (Steam & Goodreads)** – Summaries were failing due to Gemini API changes:
  - Parse both markdown-wrapped and raw JSON responses (shared `extractJsonFromGeminiResponse` helper)
  - Use `gemini-2.0-flash` model (replaces deprecated `gemini-1.5-flash`)
  - Removed debug logging from summary generators
- **Steam widget** – `getSteamWidgetContent` now returns a safe default when the `widget-content` doc is missing instead of throwing
- Log message typo: "Goodreadsn" → "Goodreads" in sync-goodreads-data

### Changed

- `.env.template`: Documented that `GEMINI_API_KEY` must not be restricted to HTTP referrers when used from Firebase Functions

## [0.20.1] - 2025-02-14

### Changed

- **Express 5** – Upgraded from Express 4 to 5:
  - Catch-all 404 route updated to use named wildcard `/{*splat}` (Express 5 path syntax)
  - Rate limiter now uses `req.socket?.remoteAddress` instead of deprecated `req.connection.remoteAddress`
- Removed `packageManager` from `package.json` (project uses npm)

## [0.20.0] - 2025-02-14

### Changed

- **Node.js 24** – Upgraded the project to Node 24 everywhere to address Firebase deprecation warnings and align with Firebase's full Node 24 support:
  - Root `package.json` and `functions/package.json`: `engines.node` set to `>=24`
  - `firebase.json`: Cloud Functions runtime set to `nodejs24`
  - `.nvmrc`: set to `24` for local development
  - GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `node-version` set to `24`
